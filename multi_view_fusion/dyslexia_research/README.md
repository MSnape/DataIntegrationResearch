A instance of the generated handwriting data is available in the data directory. If wanted a new generated dataset can be created:
Move to the handwriting_generation directory and run the generate_data.py script. This will create new sentences, text view (the transcript of the handwriting) and image view (image of the handwriting) for both dyslexic and non-dyslexic data. 

Preliminary Small-Scale Dataset:
To run analysis on the preliminary small-scale dataset (obtained from https://github.com/dlsathvik04/Dyslexia_Detection/tree/main/images ), go to modelling directory:
for multi-view analysis:
run multi_view_train_val_test_toy_dataset.ipynb 

For single view from image:
single_view_from_image_toy_dataset.ipynb

For single view analysis from text: 
single_view_from_text_toy_dataset.ipynb

Generated Dataset:
There is a copy of the generated data already available in ./data and ./data_dysgraphia (for motor dysgraphia) but this can be generated by going to the handwriting_generation directory and run :
generate_data.py 
and for motor dysgraphia data
generate_data_for_motor_dysgraphia.py

To run analysis on the generated dataset, go to modelling directory:
dyslexia_research_with_generated_data_resnet_classifier.ipynb

To run analysis on the generated dataset including dysgraphia data, go to modelling directory:
dyslexia_research_with_generated_data_resnet_classifier_dysgraphia_test.ipynb

We also provide some research with a more dense classifier head here:
