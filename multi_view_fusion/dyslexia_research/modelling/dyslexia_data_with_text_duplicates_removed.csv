The absolute activity of the reference standards can be calculated from the known activity of the lead-210 solution and the chemical yield, but this calculation is unnecessary provided the same lead carrier solution is used to prepare the reference standards and for the analyses."
51,0,./dlsathvik04/Dyslexia_Detection/data/non_dyslexic/2.jpg,Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate precipitates need be known because the concentration of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the algebraic equations. An effort was made to detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in the tracer by separating the lead-210 and the bismuth-210 by anion exchange. The 15b-counting of the lead-210 fraction began within a few minutes of completing the separation.
52,0,./dlsathvik04/Dyslexia_Detection/data/non_dyslexic/3.jpg,The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed for ten days and showed no abnormalities. Any impurity in the lead fraction must have been well below one percent. Some separated lead-210 was used to make reference standards and as a tracer in recovery experiments. There was no significant difference between these result and those obtained using the original lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical Centre which we concluded was radiochemically pure.

All precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance which had been calibrated with a set of certificated weights from the National Physical Laboratory. Complete chemical exchange between the radio-lead and the added lead carrier is necessary if the analytical results are to be correct.

Chemical exchange was complete under these conditions, but when the tracer was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to stand for several days before the addition of lead carrier, the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five percent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery of the carrier."
56,0,./dlsathvik04/Dyslexia_Detection/data/non_dyslexic/7.jpg,The presence and growth of algae in the alkaline effluent does not prevent the recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed conditions although some radioactivity remains on the algae until the metathesis has been completed by heating the mixed sulphates with three separate portions of dilute (1.25 normal) sodium carbonate solution. The strength of the carbonate solution was chosen after experiments with lead tracer alone which indicated that less lead was

No, not even an infant-in-arms but a new-born babe, a premature piece of frailty in an oxygen tent of utter innocence. The complexity of that innocence was colossal. It had layer after layer of illusion to be peeled off and replace with sad knowledgeability."
